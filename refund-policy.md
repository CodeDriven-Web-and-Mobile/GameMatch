# Game Match Refund & Cancellation Policy

_Last updated: December 22, 2025_

This Refund & Cancellation Policy explains how cancellations, refunds, and credits are handled for bookings and tournament registrations made through the Game Match mobile and web application (the "App"). It complements our [Terms of Service](terms-of-service.html) and [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.html).

---

## 1. Key Definitions
- **Organizer** – A user who creates or manages a game session or event.
- **Player** – A user who books or joins a session.
- **Service Fee** – Any non-refundable fee retained by Game Match to support payment processing, customer support, and platform operations.
- **Pending Payment** – A temporary “hold” state where a booking or tournament registration is created but not confirmed until payment is completed.
- **Coupon** – A promotional code that may reduce the price of a booking or tournament registration. Coupons must be assigned to your account unless explicitly stated otherwise.

---

## 2. General Principles
1. Game Match serves as a platform connecting Organizers and Players. Organizers set cancellation windows and refund rules for their sessions. Those rules are displayed during booking and form part of your agreement.
2. Unless otherwise stated at checkout, payments are processed when you confirm a booking or tournament registration.
3. Refund eligibility depends on the Organizer’s policy, the timing of your cancellation, and the status of the session (e.g., filled waitlist, weather cancellation).
4. Service Fees are non-refundable except where required by law or when a booking is cancelled by the Organizer before it begins.
5. **Pending Payment registrations/holds are not confirmed.** If you cancel before payment, no payment is captured.
6. If you used a Coupon, refunds are based on the amount actually paid (after discounts). Coupon value is not redeemable for cash.

## 3. Player Cancellations
### 3.1 Standard Sessions
- Cancel **before** the Organizer’s cut-off time → Eligible for a full or partial refund as stated in the session details.
- Cancel **after** the cut-off time or fail to attend → Non-refundable unless the Organizer specifies otherwise or applicable law grants a right to refund.

#### 3.1.1 Game Match Default Cancellation Windows
When the Organizer does not publish a custom policy, the following default windows apply to all sessions booked through Game Match:

- **More than 48 hours before start time** → Full refund automatically issued as in-app credit.
- **24–48 hours before start time** → 50% refund issued as in-app credit.
- **Less than 24 hours before start time** → No refund (payment is forfeited).

Credits can be used toward future bookings and do not expire, but they are not redeemable for cash unless required by law.

### 3.4 Tournament Registrations
- Tournament refund rules may be displayed on the tournament details screen (including deadlines).
- Unless otherwise stated:
  - Cancel **before** the tournament registration close time (if set) → Eligible for a refund per the organizer’s policy.
  - Cancel **after** registration closes or after the tournament begins → Generally non-refundable unless required by law or the organizer cancels the event.
- If your tournament registration is in **Pending Payment**, you can cancel it before paying and you will not be charged.

### 3.2 Waitlist Bookings
- If you remain on the waitlist and no spot opens, you will not be charged.
- If you accept a waitlist spot and then cancel, the normal cancellation rules apply based on when you cancel.

### 3.3 Repeated No-Shows
Game Match reserves the right to charge additional penalties or restrict your account after repeated no-shows or late cancellations.

## 4. Organizer Cancellations & Changes
- If an Organizer cancels a session or makes material changes (time, venue, price) and you do not agree, you will receive a full refund including Service Fees.
- Organizers are responsible for promptly communicating cancellations through the App so that refunds can be processed automatically.

### 4.1 Tournament Cancellations
- If an Organizer cancels a tournament before it starts, you will be eligible for a refund of the amount paid (including any service fees, unless required by law or stated otherwise at checkout).
- If a tournament is cancelled after it begins, refunds may be partial and depend on the organizer’s policy and applicable law.

---

## 5. Event Disruptions (Weather, Venue Issues)
- If a session cannot proceed due to uncontrollable circumstances (e.g., weather, venue closure), the Organizer must decide whether to cancel or reschedule.
- If cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund unless the Organizer offers and you accept a rescheduled session.

---

## 6. Refund Process & Timing
1. Once a refund is approved, it may be issued to the original payment method or as in-app credit depending on the organizer policy and the checkout flow.
2. Processing times depend on the payment provider and may take 5–10 business days to appear on your statement.
3. If a refund cannot be credited to the original payment method (e.g., expired card), we may provide app credit or request updated payment details.

### 6.1 Credits
- Credits (when provided) can be used for future bookings and tournament registrations.
- Credits are not transferable and are not redeemable for cash unless required by law.

### 6.2 Coupons
- Coupons must be applied **before payment**.
- Coupons must be assigned to your account unless explicitly stated otherwise.
- If a coupon is invalid, expired, or not assigned to your account, it will not be applied.

## 7. Disputes & Chargebacks
- Contact the Organizer and Game Match support (nallataifeh@gmail.com) before filing a chargeback; we can often resolve issues faster directly.
- Filing a chargeback without first contacting support may result in account suspension pending investigation.

---

## 8. Subscriptions or Memberships (If Offered)
- Recurring plans can be cancelled any time before the next billing cycle. Charges already processed are non-refundable unless stated otherwise.
- Promotional or discounted plans follow the same rules unless promotional terms explicitly override them.

---

## 9. Statutory Rights
Nothing in this policy limits rights afforded by consumer protection laws in your jurisdiction (e.g., cooling-off periods, mandatory refunds). Where such laws conflict with this policy, the law prevails.

---

## 10. Policy Updates
We may revise this Refund & Cancellation Policy from time to time. Material changes will be communicated via the App or email. Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
