# Game Match Privacy Policy

_Last updated: December 22, 2025_

Game Match ("the App," "we," "us," or "our") helps players discover, organize, and join games and tournaments at local venues. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about the information we collect, how we use it, and the choices available to you.

By using the App, you agree to the practices described in this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree, please discontinue use of the App.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Information you provide directly
- **Account details:** Name, email address, password (stored using Firebase Authentication), and optional profile fields such as skill level, preferred court type, and biography.
- **Booking, tournament, and gameplay details:** Game sessions you create or join, tournament registrations, waitlist participation, ratings, reviews, and in-app messages or feedback submitted through support forms.
- **Coupon information (if used):** Coupon codes you enter during checkout and the discount amount applied to your booking or tournament registration.
- **Media uploads:** Optional profile images or attachments you choose to upload.

### 1.2 Information collected automatically
- **Device & app data:** Device operating system, app version, language, and basic device identifiers generated by Firebase to maintain session security.
- **Usage analytics:** Aggregated engagement metrics (e.g., number of sessions created/joined, feature usage) collected via Firebase Analytics to improve product experience. These analytics do not include precise location or personally identifiable browsing history.
- **Crash & performance reports:** Anonymized crash logs and performance diagnostics gathered via Firebase Crashlytics to identify stability issues.

### 1.3 Push notifications
- **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token:** A unique token generated for your device so we can send you game reminders, waitlist updates, and administrative alerts.

### 1.4 Payment information
If in-app payments are enabled, transactions are processed by third-party payment providers. Sensitive payment data is transmitted directly to the payment processor and is not stored on our servers.

### 1.5 Location information
We do **not** automatically collect precise GPS location. Location-related data is limited to the venue and city you choose when creating or joining games.

## 5. Security
We use reasonable administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect your information, including industry-standard encryption for data in transit and Firebase security rules for data stored in the cloud. No system is perfectly secure; please notify us immediately if you believe your account has been compromised.
