# Game Match Tracking & Analytics Policy

_Last updated: December 14, 2025_

This Tracking & Analytics Policy explains how Game Match ("we," "us," or "our") uses cookies, device identifiers, and similar technologies within the Game Match mobile and web application (the "App"). It supplements our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.html) and [Terms of Service](terms-of-service.html).

## 1. Technologies We Use

### 1.1 Firebase Analytics
- Collects aggregated engagement metrics (screens viewed, feature usage, session duration) to help us improve user experience.
- Does **not** include precise location, contact data, or personal messages.
- Identifiers: Firebase Instance ID / App Instance ID.

### 1.2 Firebase Crashlytics
- Gathers anonymized crash reports (device model, OS version, stack trace) to diagnose stability issues.
- Does **not** include personal content from your device.

### 1.3 Firebase Cloud Messaging (Push Notifications)
- Uses a unique Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) token to deliver notifications about bookings, waitlists, and account activity.
- Tokens do not reveal a user’s identity but can be linked to your account inside the App for messaging purposes.

### 1.4 Device & App Identifiers
- Operating system, device model, and app version are collected to ensure compatibility and security.

### 1.5 Cookies (Web Version Only)
If you access Game Match on the web, Firebase may set cookies or local storage to remember your session and collect usage statistics. These are analogous to mobile app identifiers described above.

## 2. Why We Use These Technologies
We use tracking technologies to:
1. Provide core services (authentication, notifications, real-time updates).
2. Measure performance and understand how features are used.
3. Maintain security, prevent fraud, and enforce our Terms of Service.
4. Diagnose crashes and improve stability across devices.
5. Communicate essential updates about bookings and account status.

We do **not** use third-party advertising networks or sell tracking data to advertisers.

## 3. User Choices & Controls

### 3.1 Platform Settings
- **Mobile:** Disable analytics or reset advertising identifiers via your device settings (iOS: Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸ Tracking / Analytics; Android: Settings ▸ Privacy ▸ Ads & Diagnostics).
- **Web:** Use browser controls to clear cookies or block analytics scripts.

### 3.2 In-App Controls
- Opt in/out of push notifications through in-app settings or device notification preferences.
- Request deletion of your account and associated analytics data by contacting **support@gamematch.app**.

### 3.3 Apple App Tracking Transparency (ATT)
- We currently do **not** use third-party tracking that requires ATT opt-in. If this changes, the App will display the system prompt requesting your permission before tracking across third-party apps or websites.

## 4. Data Sharing
Tracking data is shared only with service providers necessary to operate the App, primarily Google Firebase. These providers process data on our behalf under contractual confidentiality obligations. We do not share analytics data with advertisers or unrelated third parties.

---

## 5. Data Retention
Analytics data is retained for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes described above or to comply with legal requirements. Tokens and identifiers may be reset when you reinstall the App or clear browser data.

---

## 6. Updates to This Policy
We may update this Tracking & Analytics Policy to reflect new technologies or regulatory requirements. When material changes occur, we will notify you via the App or by email. Continued use of the App indicates your acceptance of the updated policy.
