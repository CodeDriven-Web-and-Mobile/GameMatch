# Game Match Account & Data Deletion Policy

_Last updated: December 14, 2025_

This Account & Data Deletion Policy explains how Game Match ("we," "us," or "our") handles account closure requests and personal data deletion within the Game Match mobile and web application (the "App"). It supplements our [Privacy Policy](privacy-policy.html) and complies with Google Play requirements for account and data deletion.

---

## 1. Ways to Request Deletion
You can request account deletion in either of the following ways:

1. **In-App:** Navigate to **Settings ▸ Account ▸ Delete Account** and follow the prompts. You will be asked to confirm your choice before we proceed.
2. **Email:** Send a deletion request to **support@gamematch.app** from the email address associated with your account. Include your full name and any relevant booking IDs so we can verify ownership.

We may ask for additional verification to protect you from unauthorized deletion requests.

---

## 2. What Happens When You Delete Your Account
- Your profile information, authentication credentials, and associated session participation history are queued for deletion from Firebase Authentication and Cloud Firestore.
- You lose access to upcoming bookings, waitlists, and saved preferences.
- Push notification tokens are revoked, and you will no longer receive notifications.
- Any promotional credits or app balances are forfeited unless legally required otherwise.

### 2.1 Organizer Data
If you organized sessions that other players attended, basic session history (e.g., venue, date) may be retained for bookkeeping and fraud prevention. Personal identifiers are removed or anonymized.

---

## 3. Deletion Timeline
- We aim to complete deletion within **30 days** of receiving a verified request.
- Some residual data may remain in encrypted backups for up to **90 days** due to automated backup cycles. Once the retention period expires, backups are purged automatically.

---

## 4. Data We May Retain
We may retain limited information where required by law or legitimate business needs, including:
- Financial records and transaction logs needed for accounting, dispute resolution, or regulatory compliance (typically retained for up to 7 years depending on jurisdiction).
- Fraud prevention data and access logs needed to protect the platform and other users.
- Aggregated or anonymized analytics data that does not identify you.

---

## 5. Reinstating an Account
Once deletion is complete, the process is irreversible. If you wish to use Game Match again, you must create a new account.

---

## 6. Data Download Requests
Before requesting deletion, you may request a copy of your account information by emailing **support@gamematch.app**. We will provide a machine-readable export of available data within a reasonable timeframe.

---

## 7. Updates to This Policy
We may update this policy to reflect changes in our services or legal requirements. Material changes will be communicated via the App or by email. Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised policy.
