# Game Match Terms of Service

_Last updated: December 14, 2025_

These Terms of Service (the "Terms") govern your access to and use of the Game Match mobile and web application and related services (collectively, the "App"). By creating an account or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, do not use the App.

## 1. Who We Are
Game Match ("Game Match," "we," "us," or "our") provides tools for players and organizers to discover venues, create and manage games, join waitlists, process reservations, and communicate with other participants.

---

## 2. Eligibility
You must be at least 16 years old (or the minimum age of digital consent in your jurisdiction) and capable of forming a binding contract to use the App. By using the App, you represent and warrant that you meet these requirements and that all registration information you submit is accurate and complete.

## 3. Account Registration & Security
- You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your login credentials and for all activity that occurs under your account.
- Notify us immediately at **support@gamematch.app** if you suspect any unauthorized use of your account.
- We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms or present security risks.

---

## 4. Booking, Waitlists & Game Participation
- Organizers can create sessions specifying venue, sport, schedule, price, and player limits.
- Players may join games, waitlists, or request bookings. Acceptance is not guaranteed and may depend on organizer approval, payment status, or waitlist order.
- Organizers are solely responsible for honoring reservations, communicating changes, and ensuring venue readiness.
- Players must arrive on time, follow organizer instructions, and comply with venue rules.

### Cancellations & No-Shows
- Organizers may set cancellation windows or penalties within the App. Review session details before booking.
- Game Match may charge or retain service fees for late cancellations or no-shows as described during checkout.

---

## 5. Payments & Refunds
- Payments are processed by third-party providers (e.g., Stripe or equivalent). We do not store full payment card details.
- You authorize the payment processor to charge your selected payment method for all fees disclosed at checkout.
- Refund eligibility is determined by organizer policies, venue rules, and applicable law. Processing times may vary.
- Chargebacks or payment disputes may result in suspension of your account until resolved.

---

## 6. User Conduct
You agree not to:
1. Misrepresent your identity, skill level, or booking details.
2. Engage in harassing, abusive, or discriminatory behavior.
3. Upload content that is illegal, defamatory, infringing, or violates privacy rights.
4. Attempt to reverse engineer, exploit, or interfere with the App’s infrastructure.
5. Circumvent booking limits, waitlist systems, or payment obligations.

We may investigate violations and take appropriate action, including removal of content, suspension, or termination.

---

## 7. User-Generated Content
- You remain the owner of content you submit (e.g., reviews, comments, profile information), but grant Game Match a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive license to host, use, reproduce, modify, and display that content to operate and improve the App.
- Do not submit content you do not have permission to share.
- We may remove or edit content that violates these Terms or applicable law.

---

## 8. Ownership & Licenses
- The App, including all software, logos, trademarks, text, graphics, and other materials, is owned by Game Match or its licensors and is protected by intellectual property laws.
- We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, revocable license to use the App for personal, non-commercial purposes.
- You may not reproduce, distribute, modify, create derivative works from, or commercially exploit the App without our prior written consent.

---

## 9. Third-Party Services
The App integrates with third-party services such as Firebase (authentication, database, storage, analytics, crash reporting) and payment providers. Your use of these services may be subject to their own terms and privacy policies. We are not responsible for third-party failures or actions.

---

## 10. Disclaimers
- The App is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.
- We do not guarantee venue availability, participant behavior, game outcomes, or that the App will be uninterrupted or error-free.

## 11. Limitation of Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, Game Match and its affiliates will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or data, arising from your use of (or inability to use) the App, even if we have been advised of the possibility. Our total liability for any claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the App will not exceed the greater of (a) the amount you paid us in the 12 months prior to the event giving rise to the claim, or (b) USD $100.

---

## 12. Indemnification
You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Game Match, its officers, directors, employees, and agents from any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising from your use of the App, violation of these Terms, or infringement of any third-party rights.

---

## 13. Termination
We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time for any reason, including violations of these Terms or suspected fraudulent activity. You may delete your account at any time through in-app settings or by contacting **support@gamematch.app**. Upon termination, sections that by their nature should survive (e.g., ownership, disclaimers, limitation of liability, indemnification) will remain in effect.

---

## 14. Changes to These Terms
We may update these Terms from time to time. When we make material changes, we will notify you through the App or via email. Continued use of the App after the effective date of the changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.

---

## 15. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution
These Terms are governed by the laws of the jurisdiction where Game Match is headquartered, without regard to conflict-of-law principles. Any disputes will be resolved through good-faith negotiations. If unresolved, the parties agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in that jurisdiction, unless otherwise required by applicable consumer protection laws.
