# Game Match Accessibility Statement

_Last updated: December 14, 2025_

Game Match is committed to making our mobile and web application usable by as many people as possible, including individuals with disabilities. This Accessibility Statement explains our approach, current capabilities, and plans for continuous improvement.

---

## 1. Accessibility Goals
- Provide a consistent experience across devices (iOS, Android, Web).
- Support assistive technologies such as screen readers, magnifiers, and switch controls.
- Offer clear alternatives for visual, auditory, or motor impairments.
- Respond promptly to accessibility feedback and prioritize fixes.

---

## 2. Standards & Guidelines
- We aim to align with **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** success criteria for key user flows, including account creation, booking, payments, and support requests.
- Mobile accessibility leverages native platform guidelines (Apple Human Interface Guidelines, Google Material Accessibility) for contrast, touch targets, and focus order.

---

## 3. Current Features
- **Semantic UI:** Buttons, forms, and navigation elements use descriptive labels compatible with VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android).
- **Dynamic Text:** Core screens scale with system font settings to accommodate larger text preferences.
- **Color & Contrast:** Primary actions meet contrast ratios recommended by WCAG; dark mode is available for reduced glare.
- **Keyboard Navigation (Web):** Interactive elements are reachable via keyboard with visible focus states.
- **Captions & Alternatives:** Informational icons include text alternatives; critical status messages use both color and text cues.

---

## 4. Ongoing Improvements
We continuously evaluate accessibility through:
1. Manual testing with VoiceOver, TalkBack, and desktop screen readers.
2. Automated linting and widget-level checks during development.
3. User feedback from diverse testers, including those with disabilities.
4. Incorporating accessibility into design reviews and release checklists.

Upcoming improvements include expanded support for high-contrast themes, improved focus management in modals, and localization of accessibility labels.

---

## 5. Compatibility & Limitations
- Some older devices or browsers may not fully support modern accessibility APIs. We recommend using the latest versions of iOS, Android, or Chromium-based browsers.
- Third-party content (e.g., embedded maps, external payment flows) may have accessibility constraints outside our direct control; we collaborate with vendors to address issues where possible.

## 7. Third-Party Audits & Partnerships
We are open to collaborating with accessibility consultants, NGOs, and user advocacy groups to conduct audits and user testing sessions. If you represent such an organization, reach out to **accessibility@gamematch.app**.

Accessibility is an ongoing process. We review this statement at least annually and whenever major features launch. Updates will be posted here with the revision date.
